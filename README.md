# Mumbai_Local_Train
A web application that will show the current location and crowd status of train coaches and predict crowd and delay of upcoming trains

According to Google, 7.5M people use Mumbai local trains to commute on a daily basis. Many a times, people are not aware which train to catch and which coach to catch in a particular train. This leads to unequal distribution of the crowd in trains and train coaches leading to discomfort to many commuters.

To solve this problem, this project will collect the crowd data from sensors installed in local train coaches and location data from GPS and display current location and crowd status of trains and coaches. This project will also predict the delay of upcoming trains and crowd in coaches of upcoming trains.

From Indian Railways point of view, this crowd and location data can help them in replanning of the train schedule and make action plans like increasing the number of coaches or increasing the number of trains at a given period of time. The sensor data would also help RPF (Railway Protection Force) to detect any illegal alight of people from wrong gates. RPF can also take decisions based on the crowd data to increse the security in crowded stations during peak hours.

This project is currently in preliminary stage and it will work on synthetic simulator data of trains but this project can be extended to actual local trains if sensors and GPS is installed on local trains.
